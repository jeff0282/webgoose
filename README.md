# Webgoose - Web 1.0 Style Static Page Generator

**(IN DEVELOPMENT)**


# Removal of README Information

Major changes to the base API are taking place.

Consequently, the information previously noted here has been removed, as it is mostly out-of-date.

These changes will see the implementation of Webgoose Revision 5.


# Additional Notes

Webgoose has moved away from the MIT License to the GNU GPLv3 License.
